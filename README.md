## LEDBlinkRevisited

### Description 

This assigment is an intro back into coding and ardiuno. You have to set up your code to make and LED blink and also fade in and out.

### Reflection

This assigment taught me some important basic things about the aurdino and how it works. I think its set me up to continue moving through the arduino assigments.


## FiniteLEDBlinker

### Description

This assigment is about making a LED stop blinking at a certain point. You do this through variables and conditional statements.

### Reflection 

This assignment was pretty easy, as all you did was write a little bit of code to add on to your old LED Blink Revisited code.


## HelloFunctions

### Description 

Hello functions is an assignment about using functions to activate a servo, all while your distance sensor is working and can sense how far away an object is.

### Reflection 

Hello functions was a good way to understand more about the distance sensor and servo, as well as functions. 


## NewPing

### Description

New ping is a assignment for us to learn about a massive library of code for the HC-SR04. The goal is to make somethng simple using New Ping.

### Reflection

This was a cool assignment because it showed how we can use different things coded by others. Such as the new ping library.

## Photoresistor

### Description

This assignment was about using a photoresistor to sense the light in your room to create a nightlight.

### Reflection

This assignment was pretty cool because you see night lights all the time everywhere so it was nice to make one.

## HelloFunctions

I'm starting to understand a little more about arduino and I have the first assignment hello functions almost done. I have the HC-SRO4 working and sensing how far away somehting is, now I just need to get the other part working.(I will clean all of this up once I am finished with the assigment.)

I don't know where to find diagram makers.(I will clean this up and have a picture of this once I figure it out and finish the assignment.)
